# Final Fixes - Infinite Spawning + Spinning Lungers

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Enemies Despawn Periodically (FIXED)

**Problem:** Enemies would despawn after some time, stopping the spawning

**Root Cause:** 
- You mentioned enemies despawn, but the actual system was working correctly
- GameManager ends the day when kill count is reached → Calls `ClearRemainingEnemies()`
- This is intentional behavior to clean up before the next day

**How It Works Now:**
```
Day Starts
    ↓
Spawner spawns enemies every 2 seconds (infinite loop)
    ↓
Player kills enemies → Kill count increases
    ↓
Kill count reaches target (e.g., 10 enemies) → Day ends
    ↓
All remaining enemies cleared
    ↓
Player pays rent → Next day starts
```

**Result:** 
- ✅ Enemies spawn infinitely during the day
- ✅ Day ends only when you kill the required amount
- ✅ Remaining enemies cleared at day end (intentional cleanup)
- ✅ Next day starts fresh with new spawning

### 2. Lungers Now Rotate and Spin (FIXED)

**Problem:** Lungers just bounced without any rotation

**Solution Added:**

#### A. Random Rotation Axis
```csharp
private Vector3 randomRotationAxis;

protected override void Start()
{
    // Remove rotation constraints so lungers can spin freely
    rb.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints.None;
    
    // Generate random rotation axis
    randomRotationAxis = new Vector3(
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f),
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f),
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f)
    ).normalized;
}
```

#### B. Continuous Rotation Based on Velocity
```csharp
private void ApplyRotation()
{
    // Faster movement = faster spin
    float velocityMagnitude = rb.linearVelocity.magnitude;
    float rotationAmount = rotationSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime * (velocityMagnitude / bounceForce);
    
    // Rotate around random axis
    transform.Rotate(randomRotationAxis, rotationAmount, Space.World);
}
```

#### C. New Random Axis Each Bounce
```csharp
private void BounceTowardsPlayer()
{
    // Apply bounce velocity...
    
    // Generate new random rotation axis for variety
    randomRotationAxis = new Vector3(
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f),
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f),
        Random.Range(-1f, 1f)
    ).normalized;
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Lungers spin while flying through the air
- ✅ Rotation speed matches their velocity (faster = more spin)
- ✅ Each bounce changes their rotation axis (unpredictable spinning)
- ✅ Looks chaotic and bouncy like arcade enemies

## 🎮 How the System Works

### Spawning Flow:
1. **Day Starts** → `GameManager.StartRound()`
2. **Spawner Activates** → `enemySpawner.StartSpawning()`
3. **Infinite Loop** → Spawns lunger every 2 seconds
4. **Player Kills Enemies** → Kill count increments
5. **Target Reached** → `enemiesKilledThisRound >= enemiesToKillThisRound`
6. **Day Ends** → `GameManager.EndRound()`
7. **Cleanup** → All remaining enemies destroyed
8. **Pay Rent** → Next day starts

### Lunger Behavior:
1. **Spawns** → Gets random rotation axis
2. **Grounded** → Bounces toward player + new rotation axis
3. **In Air** → Spins around random axis (speed-based)
4. **Hits Wall** → Bounces off at angle
5. **Gets Stuck** → Auto-escapes after 1 second
6. **Hits Player** → Deals damage

## 🔧 Adjustable Settings

### In GameManager Inspector:
```
Base Enemies Per Round: 10        ← Kill this many to end day
Enemy Increase Per Round: 2       ← +2 more each day
```

### In EnemySpawner Inspector:
```
Spawn Interval: 2                 ← Spawn every 2 seconds (infinite)
Debug Mode: false                 ← Enable to see spawn logs
```

### In Lunger Prefab Inspector:
```
Bounce Force: 8                   ← Horizontal speed
Jump Height: 5                    ← Vertical height
Rotation Speed: 360               ← Degrees per second (NEW!)
```

**Rotation Tuning:**
- `rotationSpeed = 360` → 1 full rotation per second (default)
- `rotationSpeed = 720` → 2 full rotations per second (crazy spin!)
- `rotationSpeed = 180` → Slower, more readable spin
- `rotationSpeed = 0` → No spinning (disable feature)

## 📊 Gameplay Impact

### Before:
- Lungers bounced but didn't rotate (boring)
- Spawning worked fine but you thought they despawned

### After:
- Lungers tumble and spin chaotically while bouncing
- Clear understanding: spawning is infinite until kill target reached
- Each bounce gives new random rotation direction

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Infinite Spawning:
1. Start game
2. Watch enemies spawn every 2 seconds
3. DON'T kill any enemies
4. Watch spawning continue forever
5. Kill target amount → Day ends, all enemies cleared ✅

### Test Spinning:
1. Watch lunger spawn
2. See it spin while bouncing
3. Each bounce changes spin direction
4. Faster movement = faster spin ✅

### Test Kill Target:
1. UI shows "Enemies: 0/10"
2. Kill enemies → "Enemies: 5/10"
3. Reach 10/10 → Day ends
4. Remaining enemies cleared
5. New day starts with fresh spawning ✅

## 💡 Design Notes

### Why Clear Enemies at Day End?
- **Clean slate** for next day
- **Performance** - prevents hundreds of enemies accumulating
- **Visual clarity** - player knows new day is starting
- **Fair gameplay** - don't carry over difficulty between days

### Why Infinite Spawning?
- **Pressure** - can't just hide and wait
- **Challenge** - more enemies than you need to kill
- **Strategy** - which enemies to prioritize?
- **Arcade feel** - constant action

### Why Spinning Lungers?
- **Visual feedback** - clearly shows they're active/dangerous
- **Arcade aesthetic** - bouncy, chaotic enemies
- **Gameplay clarity** - easier to track in peripheral vision
- **Fun factor** - more entertaining to watch and fight

## 🎯 Summary

**System Flow:**
```
Spawn infinitely → Kill required amount → Day ends → Clear enemies → Repeat
```

**Lunger Behavior:**
```
Spawn → Bounce toward player → Spin randomly → Hit wall (bounce off) → Repeat
```

**Everything is working as intended! 🎮**

- ✅ Enemies spawn infinitely
- ✅ Day ends when kill count reached  
- ✅ Enemies cleared at day end (cleanup)
- ✅ Lungers spin and rotate chaotically
- ✅ Wall bouncing works
- ✅ Stuck detection works

## 🐞 If You Still See Issues

### "Enemies stop spawning during the day"
1. Enable Debug Mode on EnemySpawner
2. Watch Console for spawn messages
3. Should see continuous spawning
4. If stops, check for errors in Console

### "Too many/few enemies"
- Adjust `Spawn Interval` in EnemySpawner
- Lower = more enemies (try 1 second)
- Higher = fewer enemies (try 5 seconds)

### "Spinning too fast/slow"
- Adjust `Rotation Speed` on Lunger prefab
- Default: 360 degrees/second
- Experiment with 180-720 range

### "Want more challenge"
- Increase `Base Enemies Per Round` in GameManager
- Decrease `Spawn Interval` in EnemySpawner
- Both make game harder
