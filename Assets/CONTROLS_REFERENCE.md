## ü•™ Sandwich System

### Making Sandwiches
1. **Find a Sandwich Station** (counter, table with Interactable component)
2. **Look at it** - "Press E to make sandwich" appears
3. **Press E** - Makes ONE sandwich, adds it to inventory AND puts it in your hand
4. **Press E multiple times** - Keep making sandwiches, each press adds 1 to your count
5. **UI shows total count** - "Sandwiches: X" displays your total inventory

### Throwing Sandwiches
1. **Left-click** - Throw the sandwich in your hand
2. **Auto-reload** - If you have more sandwiches, a new one appears automatically
3. **UI updates** - Count decreases with each throw
4. **Right-click while throwing** - Zoom to aim precisely

**How It Works:**
- Each press at station = +1 sandwich to inventory + 1 appears in hand
- Each throw = -1 sandwich from inventory
- Sandwich always visible in hand as long as inventory > 0

## üêõ Quick Troubleshooting

**Sandwiches disappear after throwing?**
- This is fixed! If you have sandwiches in inventory, a new one automatically appears
- If sandwich doesn't appear, you might be out of sandwiches
- Go to a Sandwich Station and press E to refill

**Can't pay rent?**
- Find the Rent Station object in the scene
- Make sure it has the RentStation component
- Check it has a Collider
- Verify it's on the correct layer for raycasting
- Make sure rent is due (after completing a day)

**Rent Station doesn't show prompt?**
- Ensure RentStation is assigned in GameManager
- Check interaction range in PlayerController (default: 3)
- Verify the Collider is enabled

**Can't aim?**
- Check Input Actions has Aim action bound to right mouse button
- Regenerate C# class if needed

**Throws go wrong direction?**
- Make sure Camera component is assigned in PlayerController
- Check throwForce isn't too low

**Only Lungers spawn?**
- This is correct! Throwers were removed per design

**Audio not playing?**
- Ensure AudioManager GameObject exists in scene
- Assign audio clips in AudioManager Inspector

**No interaction prompt?**
- Verify UIManager has InteractionPromptPanel assigned
- Check Interactable object has Interactable script
- Ensure object has a Collider
